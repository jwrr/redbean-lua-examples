redbean-lua-examples
====================
redbean webserver examples. I'm just playing around, so take this all with a 
grain of salt. The examples build on one-another, so you jump to the last 
example and not miss out on anything.

* Example 1 - Static pages
* Example 2 - Dynamic content
* Example 3 - Cookies
* Example 4 - Sessions
* Example 5 - Accounts
